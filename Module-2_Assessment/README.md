#Nintendo Hangman: Switch Style<br>

####Here, I have created a hangman game with a theme of Nintendo Switch games. <br>

###Intended for bored users during mandatd quarantine, and nintendo geeks.

#####The user should be able to open this in their browser and select any key to start. Note that there are no space between game titale in game, ex. LuigisMansion. All letters are capoltized automatically. Select letters. Letters can only be selected once per game. At the conclusion of the game the user should be alrted with one of two messages: "Congradulations! You Succeeded!" or "You died". The game should reset, allowing the user to play again.<br>


#####Much thanks to Google and Youtube! <br>
