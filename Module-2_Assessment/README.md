#Nintendo Hangman: Switch Style<br>

####Here, I have created a hangman game with a theme of Nintendo Switch games. <br>

#####The user should be able to open this in their browser and select any key to start. Select letters. Letters can only be selected once per game. At the conclusion of the game the user should be alrted with one of two messages: "Congradulations! You Succeeded!" or "You died". The game should reset, allowing the user to play again. This game keeps track of wins and losses (fails) and displays all incorrect guesses.<br>


#####Much thanks to Google and Youtube! <br>
